# Data Storage and Management

## Introduction

This wiki page covers the data storage and management aspects of the project, which primarily revolve around user and role data models and their relationships. The project appears to be an access control system that manages user roles and permissions within an organization.

Sources: [src/db.js](), [src/models.js]()

## Data Models

### User Model

The `User` model represents an individual user within the system. It consists of the following fields:

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string',
  phone: 'string'
};
```

- `email`: A string representing the user's email address, likely used as a unique identifier.
- `role`: A string representing the user's assigned role within the system.
- `phone`: A string representing the user's phone number.

Sources: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model represents a role within the system, which defines a set of permissions for users assigned to that role.

```javascript
export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  email: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

- `name`: A string representing the name of the role.
- `email`: A string representing the email associated with the role (purpose unclear from the provided files).
- `permissions`: An array of strings representing the permissions granted to users with this role.

Sources: [src/models.js:6-9]()

## Data Storage

The project appears to use an in-memory data store, as evidenced by the commented-out code in `src/db.js`:

```javascript
// const db = {
//   users: {
//     'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
//     'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
//   },
//   roles: roles
// };
```

This code suggests that user data and role data were intended to be stored in a JavaScript object, with users being mapped to their roles. However, the actual implementation of the data store is not present in the provided files.

Sources: [src/db.js:2-8]()

## Role Configuration

The project seems to import role definitions from an external JSON file (`roles.json`):

```javascript
import roles from '../config/roles.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

Unfortunately, the contents of `roles.json` are not provided, so the specific role definitions and their associated permissions cannot be determined from the given files.

## Conclusion

Based on the provided source files, the project appears to have a basic data model for users and roles, with users being associated with specific roles that grant them certain permissions. However, the actual implementation of the data storage and management system is not fully present in the given files, as key components like the data store and role configurations are either commented out or imported from external sources not provided.
