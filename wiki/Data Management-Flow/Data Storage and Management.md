# Data Storage and Management

## Introduction

This wiki page covers the data storage and management aspects of the project. The project appears to implement a simple access control system, where users are associated with roles, and roles define the permissions granted to users. The data is stored in a JavaScript object, serving as an in-memory database.

Sources: [src/db.js](), [src/models.js]()

## Data Models

The project defines two main data models: `User` and `Role`.

### User Model

The `User` model represents a user in the system and has the following properties:

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string',
  phone: 'string'
};
```

- `email`: A string representing the user's email address, likely used as a unique identifier.
- `role`: A string representing the name of the role assigned to the user.
- `phone`: A string representing the user's phone number.

Sources: [src/models.js:1-5]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model represents a role in the system and has the following properties:

```javascript
export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  email: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

- `name`: A string representing the name of the role.
- `email`: A string representing the email associated with the role (purpose unclear from the provided files).
- `permissions`: An array of strings representing the permissions granted to users with this role.

Sources: [src/models.js:7-11]()

## Data Storage

The project uses an in-memory JavaScript object as a simple database to store user and role data.

```javascript
const db = {
  users: {
    'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
    'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
  },
  roles: roles
};
```

- The `db` object has two properties: `users` and `roles`.
- The `users` property is an object where the keys are email addresses, and the values are the corresponding role names.
- The `roles` property is an object imported from a JSON file (`roles.json`), which likely defines the available roles and their associated permissions.

## Role Configuration

The roles and their associated permissions are defined in a separate JSON file (`roles.json`), which is imported into the `db.js` file.

```javascript
import roles from '../config/roles.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

Since the content of `roles.json` is not provided, it's unclear what roles and permissions are defined in the system.

## Potential Improvements

Based on the provided source files, the following potential improvements could be considered:

1. **Persistent Storage**: The current implementation uses an in-memory object as a database, which means data will be lost when the application restarts. Integrating a persistent storage solution, such as a relational database or a NoSQL database, would improve data durability and scalability.

2. **User Authentication and Authorization**: The provided files do not include any implementation for user authentication or authorization based on roles and permissions. Adding these features would enhance the security and access control capabilities of the system.

3. **Data Validation and Sanitization**: The current implementation does not perform any data validation or sanitization, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or data inconsistencies. Implementing input validation and sanitization mechanisms would improve data integrity and security.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: The `db.js` file currently combines data storage and data modeling responsibilities. Separating these concerns into distinct modules or components could improve code organization and maintainability.

5. **Error Handling**: The provided files do not include any error handling mechanisms. Implementing proper error handling and logging would improve the system's robustness and aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

6. **Documentation and Comments**: While the code is relatively simple, adding more detailed comments and documentation would improve code readability and maintainability, especially as the project grows in complexity.
