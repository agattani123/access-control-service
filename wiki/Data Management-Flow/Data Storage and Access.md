# Data Storage and Access

## Introduction

The "Data Storage and Access" component within this project serves as a centralized data store for managing user accounts and their associated roles and permissions. It provides a simple in-memory data structure to store user credentials and role definitions, facilitating access control and authorization mechanisms throughout the application.

## Data Structures

### User Data

The user data is represented as an object, where the keys are user email addresses, and the values are the corresponding user roles or permissions. This structure is currently defined as a commented-out object literal within the `src/db.js` file.

```javascript
// const db = {
//   users: {
//     'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
//     'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
//   },
//   roles: roles
// };
```

Sources: [src/db.js:3-7]()

### Role Definitions

The role definitions are imported from an external JSON file (`config/roles.json`) and assigned to the `roles` property of the `db` object.

```javascript
import roles from '../config/roles.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

Sources: [src/db.js:1]()

The structure and contents of the `roles.json` file are not provided in the given source files.

## Data Access

Currently, the `db` object is not exported or used elsewhere in the codebase based on the provided source files. However, it is likely that other parts of the application will import and utilize this data store for user authentication, authorization, and access control purposes.

To access the user data or role definitions, other modules would need to import the `db` object from the `src/db.js` file.

```javascript
import db from './db.js';

// Access user data
const userRole = db.users['admin@internal.company']; // 'admin'

// Access role definitions
const roleDefinitions = db.roles;
```

## Potential Improvements

Based on the provided source files, the following potential improvements could be considered:

1. **Separate User and Role Data**: Instead of storing user data and role definitions in a single object, it might be better to separate them into distinct data structures or modules for better organization and maintainability.

2. **Persistent Storage**: The current implementation uses an in-memory data structure, which means that any changes or additions to the user data or role definitions will be lost when the application restarts. Integrating a persistent storage solution, such as a database or file-based storage, would ensure data persistence across application restarts.

3. **Data Validation and Sanitization**: Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure the integrity and security of user data and role definitions, especially if they are exposed through APIs or user interfaces.

4. **Role Hierarchy and Inheritance**: Introduce a hierarchical structure for roles, allowing for role inheritance and more granular permission management.

5. **Documentation and Testing**: Enhance documentation and implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the data storage and access mechanisms.

Please note that these potential improvements are based solely on the provided source files and may not accurately reflect the actual requirements or future plans for this project.
