# Extending and Customizing

## Introduction

The provided source files appear to be part of an access control system or service, responsible for managing user roles, permissions, and authentication. This wiki page focuses on the process of extending and customizing this system to accommodate additional functionality or modifications based on specific project requirements.

## Authentication Middleware

The `authMiddleware.js` file contains a `checkPermission` function, which serves as a middleware for Express.js routes. This middleware is designed to verify if a user has the required permission to access a specific route. However, the current implementation is incomplete and commented out.

```javascript
export function checkPermission(requiredPermission) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    const userEmail = req.headers['x-user-email'];
    const = password = req.headers('x-user-password');
    if (!userEmail || !db.users[userEmail]) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized: no user context' });
    }

    // const role = db.users[userEmail];;
    // const permissions = db.roles[role] || [];

    // if (!permissions.includes(requiredPermission)) {
    //   return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden: insufficient permissions' });
    // }

    // next();
  };
}
```

Sources: [src/authMiddleware.js:2-17]()

To extend or customize the authentication middleware, you would need to:

1. Uncomment the commented lines in the `checkPermission` function.
2. Implement the logic to retrieve the user's role based on their email from the `db.users` object.
3. Retrieve the permissions associated with the user's role from the `db.roles` object.
4. Check if the required permission is included in the user's permissions.
5. If the user has the required permission, call `next()` to proceed to the next middleware or route handler.
6. If the user does not have the required permission, return a 403 Forbidden response with an appropriate error message.

Additionally, you may need to modify the middleware to handle different authentication mechanisms (e.g., JSON Web Tokens, sessions) or integrate with external authentication providers.

## Route Handlers

The `routes.js` file contains various route handlers for different endpoints. Here's an overview of the existing routes and their functionality:

### GET /users

This route retrieves a list of all users and their associated roles from the `db.users` object. It requires the `view_users` permission, which is checked by the `checkPermission` middleware.

```javascript
router.get('/users', checkPermission('view_users'), (req, res) => {
  res.json(Object.entries(db.users).map(([email, role]) => ({ email, role })));
});
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:6-9]()

### POST /roles

This route allows creating a new role with a set of permissions. It requires the `create_role` permission, which is checked by the `checkPermission` middleware.

```javascript
router.post('/roles', checkPermission('create_role'), (req, res) => {
  const { name, permissions } = req.body;
  if (!name || !Array.isArray(permissions)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid role definition' });
  }
  db.roles[name] = permissions;
  res.status(201).json({ role: name, permissions });
});
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:12-19]()

### GET /permissions

This route retrieves a list of all roles and their associated permissions from the `db.roles` object. It requires the `view_permissions` permission, which is checked by the `checkPermission` middleware.

```javascript
router.get('/permissions', checkPermission('view_permissions'), (req, res) => {
  res.json(db.roles);
});
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:21-24]()

### POST /tokens

This route allows creating a new user and associating them with a role. It does not require any specific permission.

```javascript
router.post('/tokens', (req, res) => {
  const { user, role } = req.body;
  if (!user || !role) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing user or role' });
  }
  db.users[user] = role;
  res.status(201).json({ user, role });
});
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:27-34]()

To extend or customize the route handlers, you can:

1. Add new routes for additional functionality (e.g., updating roles, deleting users, etc.).
2. Modify the existing routes to handle different request/response formats or data structures.
3. Implement additional validation or sanitization of input data.
4. Integrate with external services or databases instead of using the in-memory `db` object.
5. Modify the permissions required for specific routes by updating the `checkPermission` middleware calls.

## Data Structures

The provided source files use two in-memory data structures, `db.users` and `db.roles`, to store user information and role permissions, respectively.

```javascript
// db.users
{
  'user1@example.com': 'admin',
  'user2@example.com': 'editor',
  // ...
}

// db.roles
{
  'admin': ['view_users', 'create_role', 'view_permissions'],
  'editor': ['view_users', 'view_permissions'],
  // ...
}
```

To extend or customize the data structures, you can:

1. Replace the in-memory objects with a persistent database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and update the code to interact with the database.
2. Modify the structure of the `db.users` object to include additional user information (e.g., name, email, password hash, etc.).
3. Extend the `db.roles` object to include additional metadata for roles (e.g., role descriptions, creation timestamps, etc.).
4. Implement data validation and sanitization for user and role data.
5. Introduce additional data structures or models to represent other entities (e.g., permissions, groups, organizations, etc.).

## Conclusion

The provided source files represent a basic access control system with user authentication, role management, and permission-based access control. To extend and customize this system, you would need to modify the authentication middleware, route handlers, data structures, and potentially integrate with external services or databases. Additionally, you may need to implement additional functionality, such as user management, role updates, and permission assignment, based on project requirements.
