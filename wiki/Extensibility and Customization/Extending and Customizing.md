# Extending and Customizing

## Introduction

The provided source files suggest a basic access control system for managing user roles and permissions within an application. The `src/models.js` file defines the data models for `User` and `Role` entities, while `src/authMiddleware.js` contains a middleware function `checkPermission` for verifying user permissions before allowing access to certain routes or resources.

This wiki page aims to cover the extension and customization aspects of this access control system, based solely on the information available in the given source files.

## Data Models

The `src/models.js` file defines two data models: `User` and `Role`. These models serve as the foundation for managing user information and role-based access control (RBAC) within the application.

### User Model

The `User` model represents a user entity and consists of the following properties:

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string',
  phone: 'string'
};
```

- `email`: A string representing the user's email address, likely used as a unique identifier.
- `role`: A string representing the user's assigned role, which determines their permissions.
- `phone`: A string representing the user's phone number.

Sources: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model represents a role entity and consists of the following properties:

```javascript
export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  email: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

- `name`: A string representing the name or identifier of the role.
- `email`: A string representing an email associated with the role (purpose unclear from the provided files).
- `permissions`: An array of strings representing the permissions granted to users with this role.

## Authentication Middleware

The `src/authMiddleware.js` file contains a middleware function `checkPermission` that is likely intended to be used for authenticating and authorizing user requests based on their assigned roles and permissions.

```javascript
export function checkPermission(requiredPermission) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    const userEmail = req.headers['x-user-email'];
    const password = req.headers('x-user-password');
    // ...
  };
}
```

The `checkPermission` function takes a `requiredPermission` argument, which is the permission required to access a specific route or resource. It returns a middleware function that can be used in an Express.js application to handle the authentication and authorization logic.

The middleware function expects the user's email and password to be provided in the request headers (`x-user-email` and `x-user-password`, respectively). However, the implementation is currently commented out, so it does not perform any actual authentication or authorization checks.

## Extending and Customizing

Based on the provided source files, there are several potential areas for extending and customizing the access control system:

1. **Data Storage**: The current implementation does not include any data storage mechanism for persisting user and role information. To make the system functional, you would need to integrate a database or other storage solution and update the code accordingly.

2. **Authentication and Authorization Logic**: The `checkPermission` middleware function is currently incomplete and does not perform any actual authentication or authorization checks. You would need to implement the necessary logic to verify user credentials, retrieve the user's role and permissions from the data store, and check if the user has the required permission to access the requested resource.

3. **User Management**: The provided files do not include any functionality for managing users, such as creating, updating, or deleting user accounts. You might want to extend the system with APIs or interfaces for user management operations.

4. **Role Management**: Similar to user management, the system currently lacks functionality for managing roles, such as creating, updating, or deleting roles, as well as assigning or modifying permissions associated with each role.

5. **Permission Granularity**: The current implementation assumes a simple string-based permission system. You might want to explore more granular permission models, such as hierarchical or attribute-based access control (ABAC), depending on the application's requirements.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure the system's reliability and maintainability.

7. **Security Considerations**: Enhance the system's security by implementing best practices for authentication (e.g., password hashing, token-based authentication), authorization, and data protection.

8. **Integration with Other Services**: Depending on the application's architecture, you might need to integrate the access control system with other services or components, such as user management, auditing, or monitoring systems.

9. **Documentation and Testing**: Develop comprehensive documentation and implement unit and integration tests to ensure the system's correctness and facilitate future maintenance and extensions.

To extend and customize the access control system effectively, you would need to have a clear understanding of the application's requirements, architecture, and the specific use cases for access control. Additionally, you should follow best practices and industry standards for authentication, authorization, and security to ensure the system's robustness and reliability.
