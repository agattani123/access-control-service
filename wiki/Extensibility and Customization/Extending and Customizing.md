# Extending and Customizing

## Introduction

This wiki page covers the process of extending and customizing the access control system within the project. The access control system manages user roles and permissions, allowing for fine-grained control over what actions users can perform within the application. The system is designed to be flexible and extensible, enabling developers to add new roles, permissions, and customize the access control logic as needed.

## User and Role Models

The project defines two core data models: `User` and `Role`. These models are defined in the `src/models.js` file.

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string'
};

export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

The `User` model represents a user in the system and has two properties:

- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.
- `role`: A string representing the user's assigned role.

The `Role` model represents a role in the system and has two properties:

- `name`: A string representing the name of the role.
- `permissions`: An array of strings representing the permissions associated with the role.

## Role Configuration

The project includes a configuration file `config/roles.json` that defines the initial set of roles and their associated permissions.

```json
{
  "admin": ["view_users", "create_role", "view_permissions"],
  "engineer": ["view_users", "view_permissions"],
  "analyst": ["view_users"]
}
```

In this configuration, three roles are defined:

- `admin`: This role has the permissions `view_users`, `create_role`, and `view_permissions`.
- `engineer`: This role has the permissions `view_users` and `view_permissions`.
- `analyst`: This role has the permission `view_users`.

## Adding New Roles

To add a new role to the system, you need to modify the `config/roles.json` file and add an entry for the new role with its associated permissions.

For example, to add a new role called `manager` with the permissions `view_users` and `assign_roles`, you would modify the `config/roles.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "admin": ["view_users", "create_role", "view_permissions"],
  "engineer": ["view_users", "view_permissions"],
  "analyst": ["view_users"],
  "manager": ["view_users", "assign_roles"]
}
```

Sources: [config/roles.json](https://github.com/agattani123/access-control-service/blob/main/config/roles.json)

## Adding New Permissions

To add a new permission to the system, you need to modify the `config/roles.json` file and add the new permission to the appropriate role(s).

For example, to add a new permission called `delete_users` and associate it with the `admin` role, you would modify the `config/roles.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "admin": ["view_users", "create_role", "view_permissions", "delete_users"],
  "engineer": ["view_users", "view_permissions"],
  "analyst": ["view_users"]
}
```

## Customizing Access Control Logic

The project likely includes additional code or modules responsible for implementing the access control logic based on the defined roles and permissions. While the provided source files do not include this implementation, developers can extend and customize the access control logic by modifying the relevant code files.

Potential customizations may include:

- Implementing custom authorization rules or policies based on roles and permissions.
- Integrating with external authentication and authorization systems.
- Adding support for hierarchical roles or role inheritance.
- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms.
- Introducing additional access control models or strategies (e.g., discretionary access control, mandatory access control).

To customize the access control logic, developers should follow best practices for code organization, separation of concerns, and maintainability. They may need to create new modules, classes, or functions to encapsulate the custom logic while adhering to the project's coding standards and architectural principles.

## Conclusion

The access control system in this project is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to add new roles, permissions, and customize the access control logic as needed. By modifying the `config/roles.json` file, developers can define new roles and associate them with specific permissions. Additionally, the project likely includes code or modules responsible for implementing the access control logic, which can be extended or customized to meet specific requirements.
