# Extending and Customizing

## Introduction

This wiki page covers the process of extending and customizing the access control system within the project. The access control system manages user roles, permissions, and authentication tokens. It provides a set of API endpoints for retrieving user information, managing roles and permissions, and generating authentication tokens.

The system is built using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js. The core functionality is defined in the `src/routes.js` file, which sets up the API routes and handles the corresponding requests. The `src/models.js` file defines the data models for users and roles.

## Data Models

The project defines two main data models: `User` and `Role`. These models are defined in the `src/models.js` file.

### User Model

The `User` model represents a user in the system and has the following properties:

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string',
  phone: 'string'
};
```

- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.
- `role`: A string representing the user's role.
- `phone`: A string representing the user's phone number.

Sources: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model represents a role in the system and has the following properties:

```javascript
export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  email: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

- `name`: A string representing the name of the role.
- `email`: A string representing the email associated with the role.
- `permissions`: An array of strings representing the permissions granted to the role.

Sources: [src/models.js:7-10]()

## API Routes

The project defines several API routes for managing users, roles, permissions, and authentication tokens. These routes are defined in the `src/routes.js` file.

### User Management

#### Get Users

This route retrieves a list of all users in the system, including their email addresses and roles.

```javascript
router.get('/users', checkPermission('view_users'), (req, res) => {
  res.json(Object.entries(db.users).map(([email, role]) => ({ email, role })));
});
```

- **Route**: `/users`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Permission Required**: `view_users`
- **Response**: A JSON array containing objects with `email` and `role` properties for each user.

Sources: [src/routes.js:6-8]()

### Role Management

#### Create Role

This route creates a new role in the system with the specified name and permissions.

```javascript
router.post('/roles', checkPermission('create_role'), (req, res) => {
  const { name, permissions } = req.body;
  if (!name || !Array.isArray(permissions)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid role definition' });
  }
  db.roles[name] = permissions;
  res.status(201).json({ role: name, permissions });
});
```

- **Route**: `/roles`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Permission Required**: `create_role`
- **Request Body**:
  - `name`: The name of the new role.
  - `permissions`: An array of permissions to be granted to the new role.
- **Response**: A JSON object containing the `role` name and `permissions` array.

Sources: [src/routes.js:11-18]()

#### Get Permissions

This route retrieves a list of all roles and their associated permissions in the system.

```javascript
router.get('/permissions', checkPermission('view_permissions'), (req, res) => {
  res.json(db.roles);
});
```

- **Route**: `/permissions`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Permission Required**: `view_permissions`
- **Response**: A JSON object containing all roles and their associated permissions.

Sources: [src/routes.js:20-22]()

### Authentication

#### Generate Token

This route generates an authentication token for a user by associating the user's email with a specified role.

```javascript
router.post('/tokens', (req, res) => {
  const { user, role } = req.body;
  if (!user || !role) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing user or role' });
  }
  db.users[user] = role;
  res.status(201).json({ user, role });
});
```

- **Route**: `/tokens`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
  - `user`: The email of the user for whom the token should be generated.
  - `role`: The role to be associated with the user.
- **Response**: A JSON object containing the `user` email and `role`.

Sources: [src/routes.js:24-31]()

## Authentication Middleware

The project includes an authentication middleware function `checkPermission` that is used to protect certain routes and ensure that only users with the required permissions can access them. This middleware function is likely defined in the `src/authMiddleware.js` file (not provided in the given source files).

The `checkPermission` middleware is used in the following routes:

- `GET /users`: Requires the `view_users` permission.
- `POST /roles`: Requires the `create_role` permission.
- `GET /permissions`: Requires the `view_permissions` permission.

## Extending and Customizing

To extend and customize the access control system, developers can follow these steps:

1. **Define New Data Models**: If the existing `User` and `Role` models do not meet the project's requirements, new models can be defined in the `src/models.js` file. These models should follow the same structure as the existing models, with properties representing the relevant data fields.

2. **Add New API Routes**: New API routes can be added to the `src/routes.js` file to handle additional functionality related to user management, role management, or authentication. These routes should follow the same structure as the existing routes, using Express.js routing and middleware functions.

3. **Implement Authentication and Authorization Logic**: Developers can extend the existing authentication and authorization logic by modifying the `checkPermission` middleware function or creating new middleware functions. These functions should validate the user's permissions based on the new data models and routes.

4. **Integrate with External Services**: If the project requires integration with external services or databases, developers can modify the existing code to interact with these services. For example, the `db` object used in the routes could be replaced with a database connection or an API client for an external service.

5. **Extend Data Validation**: The existing routes perform basic data validation for the request body and parameters. Developers can extend this validation logic to handle more complex scenarios or add additional checks based on the project's requirements.

6. **Implement Error Handling**: The current implementation provides basic error handling by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Developers can enhance the error handling mechanism to provide more detailed error information, logging, or error reporting mechanisms.

7. **Add Documentation**: As new features and functionality are added, developers should update the project's documentation, including this wiki page, to reflect the changes and provide guidance for other developers working on the project.

## Conclusion

The access control system in this project provides a solid foundation for managing users, roles, permissions, and authentication tokens. By following the steps outlined in the "Extending and Customizing" section, developers can adapt the system to meet the specific requirements of their project, including adding new data models, API routes, authentication and authorization logic, and integrating with external services.
