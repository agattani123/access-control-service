# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project revolves around the setup and configuration required to run the Access Control Service application. This service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it aims to provide access control functionality within a larger system or application.
Sources: [package.json]()

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application utilizes environment variables for configuration purposes. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for setting these variables.

#### Port Configuration

The `PORT` environment variable specifies the port on which the application should listen for incoming requests.

```
PORT=8080
```

This configuration allows the application to run on port 8080 by default. However, the port can be modified by changing the value of the `PORT` variable in the actual `.env` file during deployment.

## Application Dependencies

The project's dependencies are managed using the Node.js package manager (npm) and are listed in the `package.json` file.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

### dotenv

The `dotenv` package is used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file into the Node.js process.

### express

The `express` package is a popular web application framework for Node.js, which provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.

## Application Startup

The `package.json` file also defines a `start` script that can be used to launch the application.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

This script starts the application by executing the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory.

## Deployment Process

To deploy the Access Control Service, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and configure the desired environment variables, such as the `PORT`.
4. Build or compile the application if necessary (not shown in the provided files).
5. Start the application using the `npm start` command, which will execute the `start` script defined in `package.json`.

The application will then start listening for incoming requests on the configured port.

## Infrastructure Requirements

Based on the provided source files, the following infrastructure requirements can be inferred for deploying the Access Control Service:

- A server or hosting environment capable of running Node.js applications.
- Access to configure environment variables (e.g., through a `.env` file or other means).

Additional infrastructure requirements, such as databases, load balancers, or other services, cannot be determined from the provided source files.
