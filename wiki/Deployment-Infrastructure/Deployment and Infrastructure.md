# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project revolves around the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. This service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it aims to provide access control functionality within a larger system or application. The deployment process involves setting up the necessary environment variables and dependencies, as well as starting the application server.

## Environment Configuration

The application relies on environment variables to configure various aspects of its behavior and deployment. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for setting up these variables.

### Port Configuration

The application listens for incoming requests on a specific port, which can be configured using the `PORT` environment variable.

```
PORT=8080
```

This configuration sets the application to listen on port 8080 by default. However, this value can be overridden by setting a different port number in the actual `.env` file or through other means of setting environment variables.

## Application Dependencies

The project's dependencies are managed using the Node.js package manager (npm) and are listed in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The application relies on the following key dependencies:

- **dotenv**: This package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the Node.js process.
- **express**: This is the web application framework used to build the Access Control Service.

## Application Startup

The `package.json` file also defines a script for starting the application:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

To start the application, you can run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will execute the `node src/index.js` script, which likely contains the entry point for the Express.js application and sets up the necessary configurations and routes.

## Deployment Process

To deploy the Access Control Service, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the desired values for the environment variables, such as the `PORT` variable.

3. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` to start the application server. The server will listen for incoming requests on the configured port.

4. **Additional Steps**: Depending on the specific deployment environment (e.g., production, staging, development), additional steps may be required, such as setting up a reverse proxy, configuring SSL/TLS, or integrating with other services or databases.
