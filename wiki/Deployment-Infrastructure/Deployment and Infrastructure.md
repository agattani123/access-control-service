# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. This service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it is designed to be deployed as a standalone server application. The deployment process involves setting up the runtime environment, installing dependencies, and configuring the application to run on a specific port.

Sources: [package.json](https://github.com/agattani123/access-control-service/blob/main/package.json), [.env.example](https://github.com/agattani123/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example)

## Environment Configuration

The application uses the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for the actual `.env` file, which should be created during the deployment process.

```
PORT=8080
```

This configuration specifies the port on which the application should listen for incoming requests. The default port is set to `8080`, but it can be changed by modifying the `.env` file or by setting the `PORT` environment variable during deployment.

## Application Dependencies

The application's dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file, which is used by the Node.js package manager (npm) to install and manage the required packages.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The two main dependencies are:

1. **dotenv**: This package is used to load environment variables from the `.env` file, as mentioned earlier.
2. **express**: This is the web application framework used to build the Access Control Service. Express provides a set of features and utilities for creating web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Application Startup

The `package.json` file also defines a `start` script, which is used to run the application.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

This script starts the application by executing the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory. This file likely contains the main entry point of the application, where the Express server is configured and started.

To start the application, you can run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will install the required dependencies (if not already installed) and then execute the `start` script, effectively starting the Access Control Service.

## Deployment Process

Based on the provided source files, the deployment process for the Access Control Service can be summarized as follows:

1. Create a new directory for the project.
2. Copy the project files (e.g., `package.json`, `src` directory) into the new directory.
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and configure the desired port or other environment variables.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.
6. Run `npm start` to start the application.
7. The application should now be running and listening for incoming requests on the configured port.

Note that this deployment process assumes a basic setup without any additional infrastructure or deployment tools. In a production environment, you may need to consider additional steps such as building and packaging the application, configuring a web server or reverse proxy, setting up a process manager, and implementing monitoring and logging solutions.

## Conclusion

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on configuring the runtime environment, installing dependencies, and starting the Access Control Service application. The provided source files outline the necessary steps and configurations required for deployment, including setting the application port, managing dependencies, and running the application using the provided npm scripts. While the deployment process described here is relatively straightforward, additional considerations may be required for production environments, such as packaging, web server configuration, process management, and monitoring.
