# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" section covers the setup and configuration required to run the Access Control Service application. This service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it relies on environment variables for configuration. The deployment process involves setting up the required dependencies and running the application on a specified port.
Sources: [package.json](https://github.com/agattani123/access-control-service/blob/main/package.json), [.env.example](https://github.com/agattani123/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example)

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration purposes. The `.env.example` file provides an example of the required environment variables.

```
PORT=8080
```

- `PORT`: The port on which the application will run. The default value is `8080`.

## Application Dependencies

The application relies on the following dependencies, which are listed in the `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

- `dotenv`: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `express`: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

## Application Startup

The application can be started by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command is defined in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

The `start` script runs the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory, which is likely the entry point of the application.

## Deployment Process

To deploy the Access Control Service application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or obtain the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the required environment variables (e.g., `PORT`).
4. Start the application by running `npm start`.

The application will start running on the specified port (default: `8080`).

## Summary

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" section covers the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. It includes information about environment variables, dependencies, and the startup process. By following the deployment process outlined in this section, developers can successfully set up and run the application on their local or remote environments.
