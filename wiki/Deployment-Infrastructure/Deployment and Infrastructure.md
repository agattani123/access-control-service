# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. It covers the application's entry point, server configuration, and the external dependencies needed for the service to function correctly. This section provides an overview of the deployment process and the infrastructure components involved.

## Application Entry Point

The application's entry point is defined in the `package.json` file, where the `start` script is configured to execute `node src/index.js`. This script is responsible for starting the application and running the main application logic.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

Sources: [package.json:5-7]()

## Server Configuration

The project utilizes the Express.js framework for setting up the server and handling HTTP requests. The server configuration details, such as the port number, are expected to be defined in an environment variable file (e.g., `.env`).

```
PORT=8080
```

Sources: [.env.example:1]()

The `PORT` environment variable specifies the port number on which the server should listen for incoming requests. In the provided example, the port is set to `8080`.

## Dependencies

The project relies on two external dependencies, which are listed in the `package.json` file under the `dependencies` section:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

Sources: [package.json:9-12]()

### dotenv

The `dotenv` package is a module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the `process.env` object. This allows the application to access and use environment variables during runtime.

### express

The `express` package is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web servers and APIs, including routing, middleware support, and request handling.

## Deployment Process

To deploy the Access Control Service application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the necessary environment variables, such as the `PORT` variable.
3. Start the application by running `npm start` or `node src/index.js`.

The application will start the server and listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

## Infrastructure Overview

The Access Control Service is a standalone Node.js application that can be deployed on various infrastructure platforms, such as virtual machines, containers, or cloud services. The deployment infrastructure should meet the following requirements:

- Support running Node.js applications
- Allow configuring environment variables
- Provide network accessibility for the specified port

Depending on the deployment environment, additional infrastructure components may be required, such as load balancers, databases, caching systems, or monitoring tools.

## Summary

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project covers the application's entry point, server configuration, external dependencies, and the deployment process. It provides an overview of the infrastructure requirements and components needed to run the Access Control Service application successfully.
