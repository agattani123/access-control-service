# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This project appears to be an Access Control Service, responsible for managing user roles, permissions, and authentication tokens within an application or system. The service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, providing a RESTful API for various access control operations.

The core functionality revolves around managing user roles, assigning permissions to roles, and verifying user permissions for specific actions or resources. The service also handles the generation and management of authentication tokens for users.

## API Endpoints

The Access Control Service exposes the following API endpoints:

### User Management

#### `GET /api/users`

Retrieves a list of all registered users and their associated roles.

- Requires the `view_users` permission.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AccessControlService
    Client->>AccessControlService: GET /api/users
    AccessControlService-->>Client: List of users and roles
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:5-8]()

### Role Management

#### `POST /api/roles`

Creates a new role with a specified name and set of permissions.

- Requires the `create_role` permission.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AccessControlService
    Client->>AccessControlService: POST /api/roles
    AccessControlService-->>Client: Created role details
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:11-17]()

#### `GET /api/permissions`

Retrieves a list of all defined roles and their associated permissions.

- Requires the `view_permissions` permission.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AccessControlService
    Client->>AccessControlService: GET /api/permissions
    AccessControlService-->>Client: List of roles and permissions
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:19-21](), [src/routes.js:23-25](), [src/routes.js:27-29](), [src/routes.js:31-33]()

### Token Management

#### `POST /api/tokens`

Generates an authentication token for a specified user and role.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AccessControlService
    Client->>AccessControlService: POST /api/tokens
    AccessControlService-->>Client: Generated token details
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:35-41]()

## Data Storage

The service appears to use an in-memory data store (`db.js`) to persist user and role information. This data store likely contains the following data structures:

- `users`: An object mapping user identifiers (e.g., email addresses) to their assigned roles.
- `roles`: An object mapping role names to their associated permissions (an array of permission strings).

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +email: string
        +role: string
    }
    class Role {
        +name: string
        +permissions: string[]
    }
    User "1" *-- "1" Role
```

## Authentication and Authorization

The service likely implements an authentication and authorization middleware (`authMiddleware.js`) to verify user permissions for certain routes or actions. This middleware is imported and used in the `routes.js` file.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AccessControlService
    participant AuthMiddleware
    Client->>AccessControlService: Request with user credentials
    AccessControlService->>AuthMiddleware: Verify user permissions
    AuthMiddleware-->>AccessControlService: Permissions granted/denied
    AccessControlService-->>Client: Response based on permissions
```

The `checkPermission` middleware function is used to protect routes that require specific permissions. It likely verifies the user's role and associated permissions against the required permission for the requested route or action.

## Conclusion

The Access Control Service provides a centralized solution for managing user roles, permissions, and authentication within an application or system. It exposes a RESTful API for creating and retrieving roles, assigning permissions, generating authentication tokens, and verifying user permissions for various actions or resources. The service utilizes an in-memory data store to persist user and role information and likely implements authentication and authorization middleware to enforce access control policies.
