# Role Management

## Introduction

The Role Management system is a crucial component of the access control service, responsible for defining and managing user roles and their associated permissions within the application. It provides a structured approach to granting and restricting access to various features and functionalities based on a user's assigned role.

Sources: [config/roles.json](), [src/models.js]()

## Role Definition

Roles are defined in the `config/roles.json` file, where each role is associated with a list of permissions. The available roles and their corresponding permissions are as follows:

```json
{
  "admin": ["view_users", "create_role", "view_permissions"],
  "engineer": ["view_users", "view_permissions"],
  "analyst": ["view_users"]
}
```

Sources: [config/roles.json]()

### Role Data Model

The `Role` data model is defined in `src/models.js` and consists of the following fields:

| Field       | Type     | Description                                     |
|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `name`      | `string` | The unique identifier for the role.             |
| `email`     | `string` | The email associated with the role (optional).  |
| `permissions` | `string[]` | An array of permission strings for the role. |

Sources: [src/models.js:5-8]()

## User Data Model

The `User` data model, also defined in `src/models.js`, represents a user in the system and includes the following fields:

| Field   | Type     | Description                                 |
|---------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `email` | `string` | The user's email address.                   |
| `role`  | `string` | The role assigned to the user.              |
| `phone` | `string` | The user's phone number (optional).        |

## Role Assignment

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Registration] -->|1. Create User| B(User Model)
    B -->|2. Assign Role| C(Role Model)
    C -->|3. Fetch Permissions| D[config/roles.json]
    D -->|4. Return Permissions| C
    C -->|5. Store Permissions| B
```

The role assignment process follows these steps:

1. During user registration, a new `User` instance is created.
2. The user is assigned a role, which is stored in the `role` field of the `User` model.
3. The `Role` model fetches the corresponding permissions for the assigned role from the `config/roles.json` file.
4. The permissions are returned to the `Role` model.
5. The permissions are stored in the `permissions` field of the `Role` model, associated with the user.

## Permission Checking

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AccessControlService
    participant UserModel
    participant RoleModel
    participant PermissionsConfig

    Client->>AccessControlService: Request access to a feature
    AccessControlService->>UserModel: Retrieve user
    UserModel-->>AccessControlService: Return user
    AccessControlService->>RoleModel: Retrieve role for user
    RoleModel-->>AccessControlService: Return role
    AccessControlService->>PermissionsConfig: Fetch permissions for role
    PermissionsConfig-->>AccessControlService: Return permissions
    AccessControlService-->>Client: Grant or deny access based on permissions
```

When a user attempts to access a feature or functionality, the following permission checking process occurs:

1. The client (e.g., a web application or API) sends a request to the Access Control Service to access a specific feature.
2. The Access Control Service retrieves the user's information from the `User` model.
3. The user's role is retrieved from the `Role` model.
4. The Access Control Service fetches the permissions associated with the user's role from the `config/roles.json` file.
5. Based on the user's permissions, the Access Control Service grants or denies access to the requested feature.

## Role Management (Hypothetical)

While the provided source files do not contain information about role management functionality, it is a common requirement in access control systems. If such functionality were to be implemented, it could involve the following components and workflows:

### Role Creation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Admin User] -->|1. Create Role Request| B(Access Control Service)
    B -->|2. Validate Permissions| C(Permission Validator)
    C -->|3. Permission Validation Result| B
    B -->|4. Create Role| D(Role Model)
    D -->|5. Store Role| E[config/roles.json]
```

1. An admin user initiates a request to create a new role through the Access Control Service.
2. The Access Control Service validates the admin user's permissions to create a new role.
3. If the permissions are valid, the Access Control Service creates a new `Role` instance.
4. The new role is stored in the `config/roles.json` file, along with its associated permissions.

### Role Modification

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Admin User] -->|1. Modify Role Request| B(Access Control Service)
    B -->|2. Validate Permissions| C(Permission Validator)
    C -->|3. Permission Validation Result| B
    B -->|4. Retrieve Role| D(Role Model)
    D -->|5. Return Role| B
    B -->|6. Update Role| D
    D -->|7. Store Updated Role| E[config/roles.json]
```

1. An admin user initiates a request to modify an existing role through the Access Control Service.
2. The Access Control Service validates the admin user's permissions to modify roles.
3. If the permissions are valid, the Access Control Service retrieves the role to be modified from the `Role` model.
4. The role is updated with the new permissions or other changes.
5. The updated role is stored in the `config/roles.json` file.

## Conclusion

The Role Management system is a fundamental component of the access control service, enabling the definition and assignment of roles with specific permissions. By associating users with roles, the system can effectively control access to various features and functionalities based on the user's assigned permissions. The provided source files demonstrate the basic structure and implementation of role management, including role definitions, user and role data models, and the process of role assignment and permission checking.
